# oxocode-lang

Hi there, I am trying to create my own language called "oxocode" or "oxolang". if you want to contribute, you can. If you decide to check this out (for some reason), please keep in mind that this is literally my 1st proper attempt at such a thing, and i don;'t really know all the secret strategies for better and optimized code.
if you can improve my code, please first just inform me on what you are improving so that i know what changed and don't freak out.
